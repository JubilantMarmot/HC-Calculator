### memory functions

Honestly I had no idea what the M stuff is on a calculator so I looked it up. Then I coded it.

- **Memory Operations**:
  - **M+**: Store the current display value into memory.
  - **MR**: Recall and append the stored memory value to the display.
  - **MC**: Clear the stored memory value.
